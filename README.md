# Awesome Lemmy Instances

This repo was created to help users migrate from reddit to lemmy (a federated reddit alternative).

Because lemmy is federated (like email), there are many different websites where you can register your new lemmy account. In general, it doesn't matter too much which server you register with. Just like with email, you can interact with users on other servers (eg hotmail, aol, gmail, etc).

However, each server has their own local policies and configurations (for example, some lemmy instances disable the "downvote" button). The table below will help you compare each site to decide where to register your new lemmy account.

# Recommended Instances

Just **click on a random instance** from the below "recommended" instances.

Don't overthink this. **It doesn't matter which instance you use.** You'll still be able to interact with communities (subreddits) on all other instances, regardless of which instance your account lives ðŸ™‚

# What's next?

## Subscribe to ~~Subreddits~~ Communities

After you pick an instance and register an account, you'll want to subscribe to communities. You can subscribe to "local" communities on your instance, and (if you chose an instance that isn't siloed) you can also subscribe to "remote" communities on other instances.

To **find popular communities** across all lemmy instances in the fediverse, you can use the [Lemmy Community Browser](https://browse.feddit.de/) run by feddit.de.
